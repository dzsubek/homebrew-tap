  caveats <<~EOS
    VaultLight stores its session key in the macOS Keychain, and Homebrew cannot remove it.
    Before uninstalling, choose "Lock and Forget" from the VaultLight menu, or Sign Out… in
    Settings, so no session key is left behind.

    VaultLight is an unofficial client and is not affiliated with Bitwarden.
